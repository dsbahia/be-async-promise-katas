# Promise Katas
This material accompanies the **Working with asynchronous Javascript** lecture.

## How to set up

Clone and run `npm install`

To run the tests run `npm t` or `npm test`

## Instructions

Do not change the test files. 

Do not change the code in fakeApi.js.

Do not change the name of the functions as these are imported into the test files. 

Read the instructions in the comments above each function in both promise-katas-1.js and promise-katas-2.js.

Edit the function body in both promise-katas-1.js and promise-katas-2.js to pass all of the tests.

You can read the fakeApi to understand what data will get returned to you. The fakeApi is set up as if it was a real API. 
You should always check what data is returned to you and the level of nesting in order for you to access the information 
you need from the data that is returned. 

You can read the test files to understand what is being tested and how to pass them. 

If you do not understand an exercise, or get stuck, ask a mentor for help.
